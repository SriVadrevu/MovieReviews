To create a statistical calculator by analyzing data of various individual entities (records)
available in an array format from a file.

Prompt: "The program should prompt for a filename from the user. 
the file will contain the number of records on the first line, and the number 
of values for each record on the second line. A matrix of values will follow 
where each line has a unique alphanumeric identifier for the record, then the 
values associated with that record. The program will then do some basic calculations 
on the values across all the records. The premise is we are looking at census 
data and each row is an individual record from the census and each value on line 
pertains to the information in the census, things like number of residents, income, 
etc. All of the values will be purely numerical."
